<h2>Proposal Pitch</h2>

For our project, we plan to create a database of video game characters and analyze how they would compare against one another. Our concept is inspired by the *Death Battle* series on YouTube, which features hypothetical battles between different characters from different franchises. We aim to input characters along with their stats into the database and create operations that allow us to compare. Some of the ideas weâ€™ve brainstormed include calculating win probabilities and determining likely winners in head-to-head matchups. We are discussing more potential operation ideas and are still deciding what is being recorded.
